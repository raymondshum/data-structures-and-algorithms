/**
 * When to use BFS/DFS?
 */
/**
 * Use DFS is the tree is wide
 * Space complexity is larger when tree is wide (if using BFS)
 * Time complexity doesn't change
 * 
 * Use BFS for long trees for the same reason
 */

/**
 * DFS
 * 
 * InOrder
 * If using on a binary search tree, you will get an in order list
 * Can replicate the tree
