# Data Structures and Algorithms

---

## Description

This repository contains my initial preparation for self-study efforts. Performed using JavaScript (run using Node.js) as that is my most recent language. May
need to transition back to Java. 

Two potential issues: (1) Implementing heap with JS (2) Acceptability of JS as an interview language. 

Primary goal is just to gain initial foundational knowledge using language of most familiarity.
