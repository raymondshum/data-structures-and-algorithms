# Data Structures and Algorithms

---

## Description

---

This repository contains my initial preparation for self-study efforts. Performed using JavaScript (run using Node.js) as that is my most recent language. 

I may need to transition back to Java for CSUMB's DS&A course in Fall B 2021.

My primary goal is just to gain initial foundational knowledge using language of most familiarity. When ready, I plan to practice using Java and Python.
