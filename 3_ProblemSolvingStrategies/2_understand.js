/**
 * Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
 */

// 1. Implement addition.
// 2. Integers? Floats? Size? 
//    - Might be better to implement using string for large numbers.
//    - Are we always using two inputs?
// 3. Integer? Float? String?
// 4. What if someone passes 1 number in? Default value, undef. null?
// 5. Variable names (sum, num1, num2), important to plan as problem becomes 
//    more complex.
